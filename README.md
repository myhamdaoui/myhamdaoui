### Hi 👋

I'm Software Engineer Student (last year) 👨🏻‍🎓, I'm a Full Stack Developer 👨🏻‍💻 with an experience in UI/UX design.

I worked on many projects with different technical stacks, starting from Laravel, React, React Native to Spring Boot, and Angular. I'm a fast learner, I enjoy coding, solving problems and challenges and building real world applications. I'm more interested in front end, and JS technologies like NodeJS... but always open to new technologies that brings better solutions.

I have years of experience working on UI/UX projects and design in general which had a significant impact on my front end development experience.
